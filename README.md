# <E-Commerce Back End>
## Description

- The motivation for this project was to thoroughly go through it and try to understand what it was doing as much as possible. I spent a lot of time looking at what each part of this project was trying to do on the back end. While some of it was clear, the project had its challenges like it usually does.

- The project was built to better our understanding of a back-end application. It was built to complete its functionality by exercising our knowledge.

- This is solving back-end functionality with apps and data requests that we want to send back and forth between the user, the data that comes in from that and how it is then manipulated and transcribed on the back-end. 

- I learned models and what that functionality actually says when it is being built, from there it was easier to understand other pieces of information pertaining the data we had. I also learned more about making data requests and diving deeper into that. I think by far the best part was figuring out the relationship between products. Whether it belong to many, or one, it was fun diving in.
